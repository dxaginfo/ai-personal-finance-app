# AI Personal Finance App Architecture

## Overview

The AI Personal Finance App is designed with a modern web application architecture, featuring a React.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, and integrated AI services for financial analysis and recommendations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (Client)

- **Technology**: React.js with Material UI components
- **State Management**: Redux with Redux Toolkit
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js for financial charts and graphs
- **Form Handling**: Formik and Yup for form validation

### Backend (Server)

- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js
- **API**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database Interface**: Mongoose ODM

### Database

- **Technology**: MongoDB
- **Structure**: Collections for users, transactions, budgets, investments
- **Indexes**: Optimized for query performance

### AI/ML Components

- **Transaction Categorization**: Machine learning models to classify transactions
- **Budget Recommendations**: Predictive models for optimal budget allocation
- **Investment Analysis**: Risk assessment and opportunity identification
- **Expense Forecasting**: Time series analysis for future expense prediction

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the frontend interface
2. Frontend sends requests to backend API
3. Backend processes requests and communicates with database
4. AI services analyze financial data and generate insights
5. Backend sends response back to frontend
6. Frontend displays information to user
